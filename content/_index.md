👩‍🌾🧃 Hello, my name is ning.

&nbsp;

☀️ During the day I am a [freelance product manager][linkedin-url], working with teams in all stages.

🌙 Otherwise, I am a [maker][old-portfolio-url], creating random and fun stuff.

📬 If you'd like to build things together, or just to say hi, please [drop me a mail](mailto:ninginthenetherlands@gmail.com).

&nbsp;

✍️ On a side note, these days I also parent, and I document with writing, data, and doodling >> [Blog][blog-url]
