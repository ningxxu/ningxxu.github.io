Hello, my name is ning.

&nbsp;

🔎 During the day I am a [freelance product manager][linkedin-url], working with teams in all stages.

🖍 Otherwise I am a maker, creating random and fun stuff >> [Projects][projects-url]

🖌 These days I also parent, and I document it with writing and data doodling >> [Blog][blog-url]


&nbsp;


📬 If you'd like to build things together, or just to say hi, best is to [drop me a mail](mailto:ninginthenetherlands@gmail.com).
