☀️🧃 Hello, my name is ning, nice to meet you.

👩‍🌾 I am a [freelance product manager][linkedin-url] working with product teams in all stages.

📬 [Drop me a line](mailto:ninginthenetherlands@gmail.com) if you're interested in building products with me.


&nbsp;


♥ I studied [design][old-portfolio-url], and I am a maker when I'm not advising product teams.

These days I also parent, and I [document][blog-url] those tiny moments with writing, doodling, and data visualisation.
