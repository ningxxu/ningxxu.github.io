👩‍🌾🧃 Hello, my name is ning.

&nbsp;

☀️ During the day I'm a [freelance product manager][linkedin-url], working with teams in all stages.

🌙 I'm a [maker][old-portfolio-url] otherwise.

These days I also parent, and document in this [Blog][blog-url] with doodling, data, and writing.

&nbsp;


📬 [Drop me a mail](mailto:ninginthenetherlands@gmail.com), if you're interested in building products together, or just to say hi.
