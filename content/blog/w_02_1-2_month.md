Keywords: try to learn your baby

* You may start learning what your baby wants, you could pay attention to baby’s facial expression, sound or types of cry to learn the cues such as hunger, sleepy, gas or poop.
* Try to keep a schedule, around this time baby may eat every 2-3 hours.
* Often suggested schedule is: nap, feed, diaper, play, nap. However it may not work, especially for babies who can’t sleep long naps.
* Quite some babies are short sleepers at this age, they will wake up after a very short nap. Being able to transit into next sleep is a skill that most babies in this age couldn’t master. If the nap is shorter than 40-45min, always try to calm the baby down to see if you could help them continue napping. If the nap is longer than 40-45min, then try to see what they want and decide if you would try to get them to nap again or not.
* Don’t beat yourself hard if you can’t really follow the schedule, again schedule is important but it is difficult. Try to stay relaxed with your baby.
* Do tummy time, several times a day.
* The baby will still cry a lot, a lot, especially in the evenings and at night.
* It takes quite some effort to calm the baby down and to get them to sleep, but you should do it. To help them get enough sleep is important in this stage.
