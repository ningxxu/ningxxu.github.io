Keywords: much active, lots of first time

* It’s a period that lots of progress will be made, and therefore a much rewarding period for the new parents. Most babies will begin to flip themselves, or roll, they will do more dabbling, they might whine more while awake, as they transit to the ability of speaking later.
* It’s a period that lots of magic happen, they will start solids (probably you already started giving earlier), it’ll become easier to put them to sleep (if you’ve previously trained them somehow, or you may want to start training now).
* Everything seems to become easier for the parents and it’s true, however, you need to set the right expectation, which is, overall things are getting easier and easier but there’ll be back and forth, and there’ll be difficult days.
